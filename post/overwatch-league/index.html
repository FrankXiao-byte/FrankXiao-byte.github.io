            <p>Soe: Just like that the 2023 season is coming to an end and we get to look back at six incredible, unforgettable years. It's really impossible to express the emotions that all of you out there and us here on the desk are feeling right now but I will give it a try. I currently feel an insane, an immense sense of gratitude, love and pride thinking of the heroes behind the scenes who have shaped and built the Overwatch League, you all made this so much more than just a competition, this was not just a show, <strong>this was a shared dream that was uniting us across borders, languages and differences.</strong> It was the hard work and the commitment of everyone out there which was bringing the teams and the fans alike the best possible experience each and every show and all of that has been nothing short of remarkable. And to my broadcast family right here with me on stage and everyone who joined us in the past as well, your voices have guided us through the ups and downs through all the action, the past 6 years, just thank you. Your talent, your love and your passion has made this an unforgettable journey for us all. <strong>And you out there, the fans, your cheers, your tears, the unwavering support, you were the life blood of this league, you make this so much more than just a gaming community, this was a family.</strong> You are incredible and we want to thank you so much for every single moment you shared with us. <strong>And of course our teams, you all embodied sportsmanship, your dedication, you taught us resilience and teamwork through victories and defeats.</strong> And now, that we close this chapter, I think we should just look back at it and remember the moments that took our breath away. <strong>We have to remember the friendships we got to form and the lessons that we learned.</strong> So from all of us, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts for being a part of this incredible journey. <strong>It's been an honor, a privilege and a joy to share this experience with all of you.</strong><br>
THANK YOU SO MUCH!</p>
